# textadept-yaml

A pure Lua implementation with much code from the original `textadept-yaml` module.
Currently shows errors detected by `yamllint`

## Instalation

1. Install `yamllint` from ... and make it available in the PATH
2. Install this module under `~/.textadept/modules`

## TODO

1. Think about showing warnings too...
